I am currently a Researcher in the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). <br>
Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree from IIE, CAS under the supervision of Associate Researcher [Yong Liu](https://liuyonggsai.github.io/) and Researcher Weiping Wang. 
I received my Bachelor's degree in Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, where I am a member of 2011 International class (English) in Software College. 

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in **efficient large scale machine learning with theoretical guarantee**, but also include kernel methods, semi-supervised learning (SSL) and interpretability of neural networks. <br>
Indeed, my works focus on **generalization** analysis of those areas and building effective and scalable **optimization** tools for them, to channel theory and algorithms into applications.
