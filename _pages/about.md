# Overview

Since 2022, I have been working as a Tenure-track Senior Researcher at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Institute of Information Engineering, CAS in 2020, advised by Associate Prof. [Yong Liu](https://liuyonggsai.github.io/) and Prof. Weiping Wang. 

My research interests mainly lie in **large-scale machine learning**, encompassing efficient algorithms and theoretical guarantees for both conventional machine learning methods and large language models (LLMs).
My research interests include, but are not limited to:
* **Large-scale Machine Learning Methods**: federated learning, distributed learning, Nyström method, random features, sketching, etc. I focused on deriving the sharper generalization bounds for them and designing more efficient algorithms.
* **Efficient LLMs**: efficient Transformers, compression approaches for LLMs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
* **Deep Learning and LLM Theory**: theoretical studies for benign overfitting or double descent phenomenon in deep learning, as well as emergent ability and grokking in LLMs.

My work primarily focuses on **theoretical analysis** in those areas and developing **effective algorithms**, with the goal of bridging the gap between theory, algorithms, and practical applications.
